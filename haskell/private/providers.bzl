    GHC has it's own builtin linker. It is used for Template Haskell, for GHCi,

    in some ways. E.g. it strictly assumes that dynamic libraries end on .dylib
    on MacOS.

    Additionally, on MacOS, GHC produces intermediate dynamic objects that load
    C libraries by their unmangled names.

    This function returns a list of all transitive C library dependencies
    (static or dynamic), taking the requirements of GHC's linker into account.

    Args:
      hs: Haskell context.
      build_info: HaskellBinaryInfo provider.
      path_prefix: Prefix for paths in GHC environment variables.

    Returns:

      ld_library_deps: List of library files that should be available for
