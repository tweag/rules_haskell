    GHC has it's own builtin linker. It is used for Template Haskell, for GHCi,
    during doctests, etc. GHC's linker differs from the system's dynamic linker
    in some ways. E.g. it strictly assumes that dynamic libraries end on .dylib
    on MacOS.

    This function returns a list of all transitive C library dependencies
    (static or dynamic), taking the requirements of GHC's linker into account.

    Args:
      hs: Haskell context.
      transitive_cc_dependencies: HaskellCcInfo provider.
      path_prefix: Prefix for paths in GHC environment variables.

    Returns:

      library_deps: List of library files suitable for GHC's builtin linker.
      ld_library_deps: List of library files that should be available for
        dynamic loading.
