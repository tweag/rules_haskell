# We drop the Win32 package from the stack snapshot so that stack considers it a toolchain library.
# In this case we will use the Win32 provided by the compiler instead of recompiling it.
#

# but with versions <= 2.13.2.0 we encounter the following issue:
# https://github.com/haskell/win32/issues/193
