# XXX: Hack to prevent the `haskell_nixpkgs_package_list` rule from crashing:
# This rule expects a `nix-build` executable which is used to generate a
# store-path containing an `all-haskell-packages.bzl` file which defines the
# `package` list. Since actually installing `nix-build` on the netlify image
# seems difficult, we provide a dummy shell script which does exactly that.
