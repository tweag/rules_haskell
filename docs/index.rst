Build Haskell Using Bazel
=========================

Bazel_ is a tool for automating the *building* and the *testing* of
software. Follow :ref:`this guide <guide>` to get started building
small Haskell projects using Bazel. For a deeper dive and solutions to
more advanced use cases, see :ref:`Common Haskell Build Use Cases
<use-cases>`. Refer to the `Bazel documentation`_ for more about
Bazel.

Requirements:

* **Bazel:** See the `start script`_ for versions that are known to be
  compatible.
