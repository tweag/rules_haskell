# Contributing to `rules_haskell`

## Contribution Process

1. Explain your idea and discuss your plan with members of the team.
   The best way to do this is to create an [issue][issue-tracker] or
   comment on an existing issue.
2. Prepare a Git commit(s) with your change in a new branch. Don't
   forget to add [tests][tests]. Run the existing tests with
   `bazel test //...`. Update the [README.md](./README.md), if
   appropriate.
3. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
   This will start the code review process. **All submissions, including
   submissions by project members, require review.**
4. You may be asked to make some changes. Our continuous integration
   bots will test your change automatically on supported platforms. Once
   everything looks good, your change will be merged.

Please also refer to the [maintenance instructions][maintenance] for
maintenance-like contributions.
